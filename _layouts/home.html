IPAW and TaPP build on a successful history of provenance workshops that bring together researchers from a wide range of computer science fields including workflows, semantic web, databases, high performance computing, distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages, and software engineering, as well as researchers from other fields, such as biology and physics that have urgent provenance needs.</span>

              <p>
                <span>  Provenance is increasingly important in data science, workflow systems, and many other areas, particularly to support transparency, accountability and explanations. By providing a record of the data creation process and of dependencies between data, provenance information is essential for tracing errors in transformed data back to erroneous inputs, access control, auditing, repeatability and reproducibility, evaluating data quality, and establishing ownership of data.</span>

              <p><strong> Abstract:</strong> Scientific experiments are frequently written as scripts.
While scripts are powerful and convenient, they lack provenance
support. With that problem in mind, we designed noWorkflow aiming at
transparently and automatically capturing provenance of Python
scripts. In its 10 years of existence, it has been used for different
purposes. In this talk, we provide an overview of noWorkflow’s
evolution throughout the years and analyze myths and truths about it.
To do that, we go over the 150+ papers that cite noWorkflow and group
their main claims, classifying them as myths or truths.</p>

              <p><strong> Title:</strong> Provenance, Relevance-based Data Management, and the Value of Data </p>
              <p><strong> Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I introduce the audience to relevance-based data
management (RBDM), a new paradigm where information about what
data is "relevant" for producing a result of a computation, i.e.,
the data provenance of the computation, is used to improve
management of the data, e.g., by restricting computations to what
data is relevant or by making caching decisions based on
relevance. I will present provenance-based data skipping (PBDS) as
one example of relevance-based data management. In PBDS, a system
maintains lightweight sketches of the provenance of queries based
on a (virtual) horizontal partitioning of tables which are
captured at query runtime. Such provenance sketches are then
utilized to speed-up the evaluation of future queries, by
translating them into selection conditions that can utilize the
existing physical design of a databases. Additionally, I will
discuss preliminary ideas on the use of relevance as an objective
metric for the value of data.</p>

              <p><strong> Title:</strong> Provenance Semirings: Beautiful Theory and Applications in Query Debugging for Database Education </p>
              <p><strong> Abstract:</strong> Database provenance tracks the relationships between input tuples and outputs of a relational query that transforms the source data into a desired view. In a seminal work by Green, Karvounarakis, and Tannen (PODS 2007), Provenance Semirings were proposed as a formal and general approach to track data provenance as annotations to tuples produced in different stages of the transformation in a query, which was later extended to aggregate operations by Amsterdamer, Deutch, and Tannen (PODS 2011). In this talk, I will give an overview of provenance semirings and describe how the powerful concept of provenance semirings has been used in our work on building tools for helping new programmers and students learn, debug, and trace relational queries. In our work, we defined and studied the complexity of the “small counterexample” problem for query debugging, built tools for relational algebra and SQL efficiently tracking provenance with user interfaces for easy exploration and understanding, and studied the effectiveness of these tools in database education for helping students debug queries in classroom settings. The "RATest" tool for debugging relational algebra has been successfully used by more than 1000 students in our undergraduate and graduate classes in the last few years.

              <h4>Tracks</h4>
              <p>Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks: </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>IPAW:</strong><br/>Authors are invited to submit original research work to the IPAW track. This track solicits full research papers that describe mature, high-quality research on the topics of interest of the ProvenanceWeek. The title of submissions to IPAW must begin with "IPAW:".</</li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>TaPP:</strong><br/>We invite innovative and creative contributions, including papers outlining new challenges for provenance research, promising formal approaches to provenance, experiments, and visionary (and possibly risky) ideas. The title of submissions to TaPP must begin with "TAPP:".
                  <br/>
                  <p>In addition to regular research papers, we also encourage submissions of thefollowing flavors: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Short papers (up to 4 pages, including references) that would typically include work in progress or visionary ideas that are not yet fully developed, but have the potential to lead to cutting-edge research. </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      Application papers (up to 6 pages, including references) focusing on innovative applications and uses of provenance.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>“Best of the Rest”</strong><br/>As ProvenanceWeek is meant to bring together the provenance community, which is now established and publishing in conferences and journals across computational domains, the Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP) is forming a “Best of the Rest” category. If you have had a provenance-paper accepted to a conference or journal in 2022 thru February 2023, we invite you to submit the abstract to TaPP. We will invite the “Best of the Rest” to present their work at TaPP to widen the conversation.<br/><br/>
                Submit the abstract and original publication venue and date of the previously published work. The title of the abstract must begin with "BEST:".</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              We also encourage the presentation of ongoing work as posters or demonstrations.
              Proposals for posters or demonstrations should be formatted and submitted as
              described above, with the following additional restrictions:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Demonstrations:</strong><br>Using no more than 4 pages, describe the context and
                	highlights of the proposed demonstration, including a brief description
                	of the demonstration scenario. The title of the proposal must begin with "DEMO:".</li>
                  <p></p>
                  <li><strong>Posters:</strong><br>Submit a 1-page abstract of the poster. The title of the
                  	abstract must begin with "POSTER:".</li>
              </ul>
